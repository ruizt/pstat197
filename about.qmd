The capstone aims to provide students with hands-on research training and career development opportunities related to data science. It is equally suitable for students interested in entering the job market as it is for those considering graduate school -- we partner with both industry and academic project sponsors to offer research experiences spanning a breadth of application domains.

## Student experience

The capstone is for senior students of any discipline having an intermediate level of experience with applied quantitative methods of any kind and some exposure to programming. Participation is by application only; to ensure each student has close interaction with peer collaborators, faculty, and sponsors, roughly 60 students are admitted each year.

For participating students, the capstone is a year-long course sequence comprising two distinct portions: a preparatory course in data science topics and collaborative research skills (PSTAT197A/CMPSC190DD, offered fall term) and two experiential learning courses in which students work in teams on interdisciplinary projects sponsored by an external partner and advised by a technical specialist (PSTAT197B-C/CMPSC190DE-DF, offered winter and spring terms). The course sequence culminates with a public showcase of student work.

Students can expect to gain training and skills in collaborative data science and produce a strong work sample by the end of the program. All students will prepare a poster presentation for the public showcase, and posters will be published online. Depending on the project, students may also contribute during or after the project work period to other outputs such as public repositories, software products, conference presentations, or publications.

# Project sponsors

Projects are selected from proposals submitted by industry and academic partners. Any projects that create educational and professional opportunities for students are considered. Proposals that create clear opportunities for students to engage with a research agenda and potentially make original contributions are prioritized. For accepted proposals, we consult with sponsors to develop an appropriate project plan and assign a faculty or graduate student advisor in advance of the project start date.

For participating project sponsors, the program offers opportunities to engage in mentorship, advance research agendas, and establish collaborative partnerships. We have found that successful projects include students in making novel contributions to a broader research agenda based on concrete starting points. This entails that sponsors have identified a well-defined data science problem of clear value to their agenda or organization and can provide initial work (analysis, codes, relevant literature) and hands-on direction and training to students at the beginning of the project to facilitate a quick start.
